  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    Hello there! I'm Hisham Khuram from Karnataka, India.
    I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at Poojya Doodappa Appa College of   
    Engineering.<br />
    I have always been fascinated by scienceâ€”the way everything works has a strange beauty to it. In this 
    journey,I discovered coding, and it quickly became one of the most captivating aspects of my learning. 
    Among the many paths I could have taken, I chose Web Development, striving to become a Full-Stack Web 
    Developer.
